## JS Basics :flushed:

> :one: Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as :black_circle: Zero-based indexing.
><br>
> :two: Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are :black_circle: mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.
><br>
> :three: In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have :black_circle: Global scope. Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope.
><br>
> :four: Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT. One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects. Using the `slice` method instead of `splice` helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

## Responsive Web Design :v:

> :one: Flexbox consists of :black_circle: (1) flex container & (2) flex items.
><br>
> :two: :black_circle: Flexbox -- Container properties: flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, gap, justify-content, aling-items, align-content; :black_circle: Item properties: align-self, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, flex, order.

## Intro to HTML and CSS :v:

> :one: HTML provides :black_circle: structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos.
><br>
> :two: CSS can select HTML elements by :black_circle: their type, class, ID & attribute.
><br>
> :three: Divites - the excessive misuse of divs to markup a page. Use `nav` for navigation in the `header` tag. Use :black_circle: `header`, `main`, `footer` for structure HTML. Use `small` in the tag called `footer`.

## Git Collaboration :v:

> :one: Detaching HEAD just means :black_circle: attaching it to a commit instead of a branch.
><br>
> :two: There are two primary ways to undo changes in Git -- :black_circle: git reset & git revert. 
git reset will move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place ( (x) doesn't work for remote branches that others are using).
><br>
> :three: Git push can optionally take arguments in the form of: `git push <remote> <place>`. In order to specify both the source and the destination of place: `git push origin <source>:<destination>`. 
:black_circle: Pushing nothing to a remote branch deletes it -- `git push origin :foo`

## Linux CLI, and HTTP :v:

> :bulb: https://linuxsurvival.com/command-list/

> :one: Linux is :black_circle: case-sensitive.
><br>
> :two: Renaming files is simply a case of :black_circle: "moving" a file from one name to another. For example, to rename file "wolves" to "coyotes", you would type mv wolves coyotes.
><br>
> :three: **HTTP Request** is made up of the following parts:
> 1. :black_circle: **REQUEST LINE** - it consists of a **verb** (**GET** - **POST** - **PUT** - **DELETE**), a path, and the HTTP version.
> 2. :black_circle: **HEADERS** (= communication format); - `Connection`: used to decide if the network connection needs to be closed or open once a request is completed. Possible values are `keep-alive` or `closed`.
> 3. :black_circle: **BODY** (optional) (= form submission);

## Git & GitHub :v:

> :one: Git thinks about its data like a :black_circle: **stream of snapshots**.
> <br>
> :two: Git has three main states where the local files can reside: :black_circle: **modified, staged, and committed**.
> <br>
> :three: Git uses :black_circle: **HEAD** as the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit.
